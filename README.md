Built with SFML and C++ 17 with CMAKE

Currently being built for Linux systems but Windows should work fine.

Assets folder is duplicated on build. Replacing the map.png file with an equivalent map (colours are important) would allow for a different world.

Slowly creating a primitive engine of my own to support the project, realisitcally out of scope, but I've learnt a bit and can use it again later, would prefer to keep things SFML agnostic.
